Daily Reflections

## Description

This is just a simple project that is a daily reflection, based off what we doing everyday after class 
at Emerging Digital Academy. Hope you enjoy yourself going thru the questions updated versions at a later date.

## Installation

1. Create your database all the information can be found inside data.sql. All you have  to do is copy paste
into your pgAdmin or Postico. 
2. Open up your terminal and type in npm install.
3. In terminal type npm run server.
4. In a new terminal page type npm run client and it will automatically open up the browser tab for you.

## Usage

This a very simple to use application. It is a step by step process. 
Start on the main page and just click the button to get started.
Next each page will have a input and 2 buttons one to go back incase you need to change 
something on previous page and one to go forward to the next question.
Once you reach the review page you will see everything you put in and all you have to do is hit submit
to add all the information to the database.
